\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

This report uses the \emph{how much did it rain ii} \cite{rain, Lakshmanan16}
dataset from \emph{kaggle.com} for the analysis of different sketching methods.
The original dataset contains 13,765,201 training samples
with 23 features and 1 prediction value.
See the Appendix for detailed description of features.
Since it contains null values, and outliers,
we will do a preprocess and only use a subset of samples.

\subsection{Baseline and Preprocess}

Since some observations are not complete,
we first filter out 2,769,088 samples that do not contain missing values.
The first two features \emph{id} and \emph{minutes\_past}
are used just for identification rows,
thus we omit them and
get data matrices
\begin{equation}
    A_0 \in \real^{2769088\times 21}, \,
    b_0\in\real^{2769088}
\end{equation}

Let's look at the distribution of these features first.
