\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

In this report, we deal with the low-rank approximation problem.
Given an $n\times d$ matrix, $A$,
we would like to find a matrix $\tilde{A}_k$,
such that
\begin{equation}
    \| A - \tilde{A}_k \| \le (1+\varepsilon) \| A - A_k \|,
\end{equation}
where $A_k$ is the best rank-$k$ approximation oto $A$,
and $\tilde{A}_k$ has rank $k$.
The best approximation $A_k$ can be computed by a svd operation.

\subsection{Dataset}

MovieLens 20M dataset~\cite{movielens}.

\subsection{Experiment Setting}

\section{Baseline}

We did svd directly to the full version of the matrix,
which took 21403 seconds.
