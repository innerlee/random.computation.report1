\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

This report uses the \emph{how much did it rain ii} \cite{rain, Lakshmanan16}
dataset from \emph{kaggle.com} for the analysis of different sketching methods.
The original dataset contains 13,765,201 training samples
with 23 features and 1 prediction value.
Since it contains null values, and outliers,
we will do a preprocess and only use a subset of them.
