\section{Discussion}

From the experiment results,
we can see that
\begin{itemize}
    \item The preparation time for the sketching is large in
    experiments. Efforts should be made to reduce this time.
    The second step, \ie, solving the smaller sized problem
    take negligible amount of time.
    \item The performance of the four sketching are
    Leverage Score, Count Sketch, PHD, and Gaussian
    in decreasing order.
    \item The loss can be very near to the ground truth.
    Especially for the Leverage Score method.
\end{itemize}
Thus sketching methods is promising in large scale problems.
