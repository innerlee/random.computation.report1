\subsection{Dataset Description}

The following dataset description was extracted from web page \cite{rain}.

\begin{description}[align=left,labelindent=2em]
\item [Id]  A unique number for the set of observations over an hour at a gauge.
\item [Minutes\_past]  For each set of radar observations,
the minutes past the top of the hour that the radar observations were carried out.
Radar observations are snapshots at that point in time.
\item [Radardist\_km]  Distance of gauge from the radar whose observations are being reported.
\item [Ref]  Radar reflectivity in km.
\item [Ref\_5x5\_10th, Ref\_5x5\_50th, Ref\_5x5\_90th]
10th, 50-th, 90-th percentile of reflectivity values
in 5x5 neighborhood around the gauge.
\item [RefComposite, RefComposite\_5x5\_10th, RefComposite\_5x5\_50th, RefComposite\_5x5\_90th]
Maximum reflectivity in the vertical column above gauge.  In dBZ.
\item [RhoHV, RhoHV\_5x5\_10th, RhoHV\_5x5\_50th, RhoHV\_5x5\_90th]  Correlation coefficient.
\item [Zdr, Zdr\_5x5\_10th, Zdr\_5x5\_50th, Zdr\_5x5\_90th]    Differential reflectivity in dB
\item [Kdp, Kdp\_5x5\_10th, Kdp\_5x5\_50th, Kdp\_5x5\_90th]  Specific differential phase (deg/km)
\item [Expected]  Actual gauge observation in mm at the end of the hour.
