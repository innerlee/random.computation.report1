\section{Baseline}

We did a svd directly to the full version
(\ie, none sparse algorithms used) of the matrix,
which took
\begin{equation}
    t_0=21403
\end{equation}
 seconds, about $6$ hours.
The eigenvalues was shown in Figure~\ref{fig:eig}.
We can see that the dominating values only take a small proportion.
For example,
known that the largest eigenvalue is 7383.58,
there are only 81 eigenvalues that are larger than 500,
and when we set the threshold to be 1000,
merely 15 of them survive.
% > 500: 81
% > 600: 48
% > 700: 33
% > 800: 24
% > 900: 19
% > 1000: 15
So it is reasonable to use a low-rank matrix to approximate the data.
We also show the distribution of eigenvalues that are larger than 500
in Figure~\ref{fig:eig}.

To find a gook rank $k$,
we plot the curve of error energy (squared Frobenius norm) v.s. rank $k$
in Figure~\ref{fig:rank}.
Since there are quick methods (like sparse svd function \textit{svds()} in Julia)
computing part of the svd given rank $k$,
The running time of svds() is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:rank}.
We can see that when $k=300$,
the relative error energy is around 40\% and
the running time for svds in this setting is
\begin{equation}
    t_1=560
\end{equation}
seconds.
We will set
\begin{equation}
    k=300
\end{equation}
in the following experiments since it captures most of the energy
as well as keeps a relative small rank at the same time.
